                  _The Men of Sussex crying after him_


              Andrew, what of the North?
                In November shadows drear
              We have heard thee marching forth
                With songs of a glad new year.
              Thou goest to mountains high,
                To Picts in a Northern fen—
              But, Andrew, tarry and hear the cry
                Of the little Southern Men.

              Down by the seas of Gaul,
                Where the Roman eagles stand,
              Anderida they call
                Our shaggy forest land.
              We have no saving health,
                To us no Word comes forth,
              On us the gods bestow no wealth—
                Yet Andrew goes to the North.

              Oh, stay and give us grace,
                For our hearts are grey with dule,
              As each man lifts his face
                In the dreadful days of Yule,
              When the burning Wheel stands still
                In the black and dropping skies,
              And the Long Man screams upon the hill
                With the human sacrifice.

              Andrew, what of the North?
                Our Druids tell sad tales,
              Our arms have lost their worth
                In the scrubby hills of Wales;
              But thy mighty banners go
                Forward and pass us by,
              As the Northern streamers fly and flow
                On the red wings of the sky.

              We hear strange tales of thee—
                We hear thou preachest still
              A Man more fair than Bald, a Tree
                More tall than Ygdrasyl,
              A Bread more strong than meat,
                Water more fierce than wine—
              Than the mead which drunken gods find sweet
                In the halls where Heroes dine....

              To the little Southern Men
                Saint Andrew answered he:
              “I have heard from the Northern fen
                Your moan from the Gaulish sea;
              And though I pass you by,
                And may not see your face,
              Yet my Lord hath heard your cry,
                And He sends you hope of grace.

              “Three saints shall teach the land
                That lies by the Southern sea;
              Three saints on your shores shall stand—
                A thrice-noble company.
              The Word that heals and saves,
                Which to the Scots I send,
              Wilfred shall teach by the waves
                That beat on Manhood’s End.

              “On Havant’s drawling tide,
                Which round the island swells,
              The solemn ships shall glide
                To the chime of Richard’s bells:
              On Mayfield’s hills the iron
                Of Dunstan’s anvil rings
              As he hammers gates for Zion
                And fights Unholy Things.

              “So faint not—all is well,
                And the price of hope is paid
              By the Lord Who hath harrowed hell,
                And hath made the gods afraid.
              Eternity keeps the hours
                Till the Sussex Saints go forth—
              Wilfred and Richard and Dunstan are yours,
                But Andrew goes to the North.”




             ST. PHILIP & ST. JAMES TO ST. SIMON & ST. JUDE


        Said the May Day Saints to the Grey Day Saints,
        Singing across the year:
        How is it with you in October?
        With us the meadows are green,
        And the grass is warm with the sun,
        And strown with the golden pence
        Of the coltsfoot, our offertory.
        The tapers are lit for our feast—
        Tall tapers are lit for our feast
        In the drooping horse-chestnut boughs;
        And the thrushes serve our Mass
        There in the white thorn hedge,
        Where the bloom is breaking against
        A smudgy, sweet, grey sky
        That shall give us holy water....
        Oh, tell us, October Saints,
        How you fare at the end of the year.
        Are you cold in the draught of the year?—
        On the edge of the fog of All Saints
        And the gloom of the Holy Souls?

        Said the Grey Day Saints to the May Day Saints,
        Singing across the year:
        How is it with you in the Spring?
        The leaves in the wood are red,
        And the frightened trees are a-shake
        Down by the moaning brook.
        The birds sweep the sky with desperate wings of escape.
        There is none to serve our Mass,
        And the high wind is our Priest.
        No censer swings for us
        From the lime-tree’s blossomed boughs;
        Yet have we joy of our feast,
        For we know that the Child is near—
        The Child Who is born in December,
        In the frozen December stillness.
        Round Him the year shall wake,
        And climb up the Spring into May,
        To the feast of Philip and James.
        The tapers of Christ’s own Mass
        Shall rekindle the fading sun,
        And Mary shall lift her Babe
        To the horn of the wintry moon,
        And ride Him into a Happy New Year.




                          ST. PETER & ST. PAUL
                          _The Gate of Lewes_


            St. Peter sits on Caburn Hill,
              St. Paul sits high on Beacon Down,
            And there, each side of Wakeland’s Mill,
              They guard the way to Lewes Town:
            They hold the Sword and Keys in state—
              Our bands are loosed, our sins forgiven—
            They sit there guarding Lewes Gate
              As they would guard the Gate of Heaven.

            _For Lewes Town like Heaven is,
            And Heaven is like Lewes Town._

            The golden streets go up the hill,
            In sunshine dreaming, warm and still;
            Ouse river through the vale below
            Like Sion’s Stream of Life doth flow,
            And many fruits our fruit-trees bear—
            Plum, cherry, apple, quince, and pear—
            And in our streets the live-long day
            The girls and boys are at their play.
            When evening falls the church bells ring,
            And faithful voices pray and sing;
            When morning comes the faithful feet
            Tread to the altar-paces sweet.
            The Lamb is with us day and night,
            So, like high Heaven’s, our streets are bright.
            The Lamb is with us night and day,
            So two Apostles guard the way
            ’Twixt Caburn Hill and Beacon Down,
            The way that leads to Lewes Town.

            _For Lewes Town like Heaven is,
            And Heaven is like Lewes Town._

            Oh, great St. Peter, hear our cry
              From your high sunset seat on Firle,
            Promise by Him you did deny
              That our dear city’s gates of pearl
            Shall not be forced by any foe;
              Nor any soul that mongers sin,
            Or in defilement loves to go,
              Or makes a lie, shall enter in.

            Oh, great St. Paul on Mount Caburn,
              Promise by Him you sought to slay
            That your fierce, fiery sword shall turn
              Both east and west and every way
            To guard the sunrise road that swings
              Past Glynde and Wick and Stonery,
            Because it is the road of kings,
              Who bring their glory from the sea.

            They bring their glory to our feast,
              As to the New Jerusalem;
            They are the Wise Kings of the East,
              Who journeyed once to Bethlehem;
            And through our streets they’ll ride in state,
              From Brooks to Priory, up and down,
            And praise the Saints who guard our Gate—
              The holy Gate of Lewes Town.




                           ST. MARY MAGDALENE


   Mary Magdalene has looked out of her window,
   High in her cottage at Horeham Road;
   From her high window has Mary looked down,
   And seen all the doings and sights of the town:
   The boys look up as they pass her abode—
   The boys look up, but the girls look down.

   Mary Magdalene has caught sight of the Preacher—
   The Preacher Who’s come from the town in the west;
   She hears Him preaching out there on the Green:
   His words have troubled her heart—she has seen
   His face, and the sobs are all thick in her breast,
   And her tears are the saltest that ever were seen.

   From Horeham Road to Boreham Street
   And High Horse Bridge where the waters meet—
   East or west, was there ever seen
   Such a preaching, such a teaching for Mary Magdalene?

   A boy calls up to her there at the window:
   “Come down, my sweet, for the night is here,
   And the stars are dim in the mists above,
   And the darkening field is the place for love—
   Come down, my lovely, come down, my dear,
   And show me beauty and give me love.”

   But Mary Magdalene still stands at the window,
   And the dusk is white on her tear-stained face,
   For the Preacher has broken her heart, and it turns
   To the Word that freezes, the Word that burns,
   The Word that is Flesh in the market-place,
   Where the Preacher’s voice through the silence burns.

   From Horeham Road to Boreham Street
   And High Horse Bridge where the waters meet—
   East or west, was there ever seen
   Such a turning, such a burning for Mary Magdalene?

   Mary Magdalene has gone down to the Preacher—
   The strange Young Man from the western town:
   With silk she is shining, with scent she is sweet,
   Her eyes are like water, like flowers are her feet,
   And when she has come to the Green she falls down
   Before the Young Preacher and kisses His feet.

   She kisses His feet and she cries out for pardon,
   With tears and with kisses His feet are all wet;
   The boys are all staring and no word is said,
   For she wipes His wet feet with the hair of her head—
   Her lovely brown hair that no boy can forget,
   It is like a brown beech-wood, the hair of her head.

   From Horeham Road to Boreham Street
   And High Horse Bridge where the waters meet—
   East or west, was there ever seen
   Such a sighing, such a crying for Mary Magdalene?

   And the Preacher has stooped, and has blessed her and raised her,
   And the boys are all laughing to see them stand so:
   “Ah, lovely, and have you forgotten so soon
   The ways of a woman, the ways of the moon,
   And all the gay gallants with whom you would go
   And show them the madness that’s under the moon?”

   The Preacher has brought Magdalene to His mother,
   And His mother has given her a white gown to wear,
   And they’ve sat down to supper together all three,
   And the boys stand outside in the street and agree
   That the joke’s gone too far—“Come out, Mary, my dear,
   For you and these strangers will never agree.”

   But Mary Magdalene has looked out of the window—
   She stands in the window all white and alone—
   “I will never return while the stars are above
   To the ways that were far from the true ways of love.
   Oh, many a lover poor Mary has known,
   But never till now has she learned to know love.”

   From Horeham Road to Boreham Street
   And High Horse Bridge where the waters meet—
   East or west, was there ever seen
   Such a story, such a glory for Mary Magdalene?




                              ST. MATTHEW


    Matthew the Publican sits at the gate of September,
    Counting the gold of the passing and vanishing year—
    The gold that the Summer must pay with her tears and sighings—
            The gold of the falling leaves.

    The Lord goes by and, turning, says unto Matthew:
    “Follow Me—follow Me down the long months into Winter,
    “Follow Me—follow Me down through the fogs of November,
    “When the coin of the year is spent and the trees are beggared,
    “With never a golden leaf to drop at the gate—
            “Follow Me.”

    Matthew the Publican rises to follow his Lord;
    But first he will make a feast at the gate of September—
    He will make a feast for the sinners and Saints of the year.
    The way is long and the Autumn paths are dreary,
    So before he treads the dark road into the rain
    He makes a great golden feast, the last feast of Summer,
    And he throws his golden treasury over the fields.
    The dying, fluttering, shimmering leaves of September,
    The last of the daisies and coltsfoot and dandelions,
    Are Matthew the Publican’s treasure, his gold and silver,
    Which he throws at his Master’s feet, the feet he must follow
    Down, down the Autumn, into the fogs—
            To the end of the year.




                           THE ASCENSION DAY


               So Thou hast left us and our meadows,
               Lord, Who hast blessed us and our meadows—
               Lord of the sorrel-hearted hay,
               Lord of the pollened flowers of May.
               From our fields Thou hast ascended,
               Passing into the anthered light
               Beyond the sun, by the winds attended—
               And the Sussex fields are white
               With daisies, and the diadem
               Of the hawthorn crowns the hedge,
               And at the blue pond’s reedy edge,
               Like a broidered, silken hem
               The yellow irises are blown.
               Lord, Thou art gone, and gone alone.

               Dost Thou think of us and our meadows,
               Lord, Who hast left us and our meadows?
               In shining pastures of the sky
               Thou walkest, Lord, ascended high.
               The stars are flowers about Thy feet,
               And looking up to Thee we see
               The River flowing silently—
               The Milky River, broad and sweet
               As Rother River here below,
               While planets the dim marshes strow,
               And constellations flower and fade....
               O Lord, Thou hast Thy country there,
               The fields and meadows of the sky,
               The fields and meadows ever fair,
               The dear, divine, undying glade.
               At night we too walk in Thy meadows,
               We walk beside Thee in Thy meadows.
               At midnight I may hear Thy call,
               And ride to Thee on the moon’s light—
               To where the living waters fall,
               And the unfading fields are bright.
               The stars are flowers about our feet,
               And at my side Thou art the sweet
               Perfumed, eternal Breath of May....

               With a sob the pale-eyed day
               Wakens at the Rother’s mouth,
               And back to earthly fields I go,
               And back to earthly toil, and slow
               Hot days of the slow, drawling South,
               Toiling to keep the fields alive,
               For our poor meadows cannot thrive
               On just the memory of Thy feet,
               Which trod them once and found them sweet.
               Our tears, our sweat, must give them life,
               For Thou, our Lord, hast gone on high
               To golden countries of the sky,
               To golden fields of golden stars,
               Beyond the echo of our strife....
               Yet there, upon the shining hill,
               Thou dreamest of our meadows still,
               And, Lord, we have Thy promise plain
               That Thou wilt walk in them again.




                               PENTECOST
                             _Veni Creator_


                Dear Heart of the Eternal Rose—
                  O many-coloured Heart of Fire—
                That in our Lord’s green garden grows,
                  Come, Holy Ghost, our souls inspire.

                Sweet Honey of the heavenly flowers,
                  Distilled from the white lily’s heart,
                Drip on these thirsty lips of ours—
                  Thou the anointing Spirit art.

                O Wind, down heaven’s long lanes ablow,
                  Warm, perfume-laden Breath of Love,
                O Sweetness, on our hearts bestow
                  Thy blessed unction from above.

                O Sun, in the mild skies ashine,
                  O Moon, bewitching all the night,
                These dark and groping ways of mine
                  Enable with perpetual light.

                Dear Absolution of the Sun,
                  Dear Quickener of the meadow’s grace,
                When the day’s course of toil is run,
                  Anoint and cheer our soiléd face.

                When evening falls and darkness creeps,
                  And the long starry hours have come,
                And all the world is tired, and sleeps,
                  Keep far our foes, give peace at home.

                O Sun, O Wind, O Flower, O Fire!...
                Come, Holy Ghost, our souls inspire!




                             CORPUS CHRISTI


   Now Thou hast come to the end of Thy pilgrimage, Lord;
   Thy lamp glows red like a star at the dim lane’s turning:
   The bread and the wine of Thy supper are set in the shadows,
   And the gleam of Thy cottage calls toilers and wanderers home.

   In the feathery green of the hedges the chervil is blooming—
   Petals and wafers of scent, like the Host in a dream....
   The night wind is singing the Mass of Thy living and dying,
   O Pilgrim of Love, Who at last hast come to Thy shrine.

   Thou art at peace. At Thy journey’s end Thou sittest,
   Thy cheek on Thy folded hands, before Thee the bread and wine,
   While far down the sky the yellow moon dips to her dying,
   And the big stars hang like lamps in the fading west.

   Lord of the journey’s end, if I too should stumble
   At last to the long lane’s turning, there may I see
   The beckon and gleam of the lamp that is hung in Thy cottage,
   Calling me home to my supper, my friends, and sleep.

   The Saints sup with Thee, there in the dusk and lamplight—
   Mary and Joseph and Peter and all my friends—
   With faces propped on their tired and toil-worn fingers,
   And kind eyes full of the peace of the journey’s end.

   To that feast of the Saints in Light, dear Lord, please bring me,
   Wash my dusty feet as on Maundy long ago;
   At the end of the day let me find my Lord at supper,
   And forget my toils with Him in the Breaking of Bread.




                             THE CONCEPTION
                                 B.V.M.


             _Anna’s Voice_:

             Down by the rushes I paused and bent—
             I bent with a sudden lovely pang of joy,
             And I knew that my hope was true....
             Lord God of our fathers, if Thou send me a son
             He shall be bred in Thy fear,
             But if Thou send me a daughter
             She shall be bred in Thy love.
             Lord, I pray Thee, send me a girl.




                          LADY DAY IN HARVEST
      A LULLABY FOR THE FALLING ASLEEP OF THE BLESSED VIRGIN MARY

                                   ❦


                MARY _sleeps—and as she sleeps the
                angels sing_:

            Sleep, sleep, sweetly sleep,
            Sweetly sleep, sleep, sleep,
            You who rocked the cradle—so—
            In the stable long ago.
            Golden Rose of David’s stem,
            Sleep, and dream of Bethlehem;
            Dream of herald angels singing,
            Dream of Christmas bells a-ringing
            In the steeples of the town,
            Telling of the Christ come down
            To a stable long ago;
            Dream in harvest of the snow;
            Dream His head is on your breast,
            Then, smiling, sleep and take your rest—
            Golden Rose of David’s stem,
            Sleep and dream of Bethlehem.


                MARY _sleeps—and as she sleeps her
                Son sings_:

            Sleep, sleep, sweetly sleep,
            Sweetly sleep, sleep, sleep:
            You rocked the cradle once for Me,
            Mother of sweet liberty;
            And now I sing your lullaby,
            While angels watch us from the sky,
            And the August stars are bright
            In the dark, hop-scented night.
            Rest, darling mother, rest
            With your head upon My breast,
            For all the hundred happy hours
            That My head has lain on yours.
            Mother whose hair is grey with love,
              With memories of Calvary’s day....
            Darling, in the fields above
              The young angels wait to play,
            And all the holy innocents,
              Who once laid down their lives for Me,
            Will climb into your lap and lie
              Where once I lay so lovingly.
            Rest, darling mother, rest
            With your head upon My breast.


                MARY _sleeps—and as she sleeps we
                all sing_:

            Sleep, sleep, mother, sleep,
            Sweetly sleep, sleep, sleep;
            On His bosom lay your head,
            While the angels watch your bed,
            And the August stars are red—
              Little mother of joy divine,
              Little mother of purity,
              Sweet mother of eternity—
            (You our mother and He our Brother);
            So shall heaven’s windows shine
            With lights of home, burning softly down,
              On your children on their way
              To your door—until the day
            When we reach our native town:
            And our hands shall knock, and yours unlatch,
            And we shall come home to you under the thatch—
            To you our mother, to Him our Brother,
            So shall we love you and Him and each other.
              Little mother of joy divine,
            From your window in heaven look down,
            And light the way to our native town.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
